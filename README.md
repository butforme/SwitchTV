Twitch client for the Nintendo Switch

## Installation

2. Copy .nro to /switch/ directory on your sd card
3. Launch SwitchTV from the hbmenu

## Disclaimer

This project is very barebones in its current state. If the demand is high enough, I may make a custom GUI to allow for a more seamless and feature-rich experience.

Feel free to contribute ideas and/or point out bugs on the Issues page, and I will get around to them when I have the time. 

## Screenshots

*Screen capture is force disabled when the switch's embedded web browser is open, so I can only offer these top-down photos for now. Looking for a way around that, as I imagine people may want to capture clips directly to their album*
